# Data folder

This folder contains all data used and generated in the project, including raw data, sample data, and derived datasets.  
Due to participant privacy and data protection considerations, not all data contained in this folder is publicly shared.

## Folder overview

### 1_raw_data/ (ignored)
This folder contains the complete raw data from all participants who took part in the study.  
These files are required to reproduce the full dataset but are **not included in the repository** due to ethical and privacy considerations.

---

### 1_raw_data_sample/ (tracked)
This folder contains a small subset of anonymized raw data files provided as examples.  
The sample data can be used to:
- run the preprocessing pipeline,
- understand the structure of the raw data,
- verify that the preprocessing code works as intended.

The sample data do **not** include identifying information.

### 2_preprocessed_data/ (ignored, generated)
This folder contains preprocessed data files generated from the raw data.

- **Generated by:**  
  `raw_to_preprocessed/convert_csv_inpersonData.py`
- **Input:**  
  `1_raw_data/` or `1_raw_data_sample/`
- **Output:**  
  Preprocessed data files used for subsequent analyses

This folder is **not included in the repository**, but can be recreated by running the preprocessing script.

> **Note:**  
> The `2_preprocessed_data/` folder must exist inside `data/` before running the preprocessing script. The script will populate the folder with output files.
> To generate these files using the code provided change `1_raw_data` to `1_raw_data_sample` in the code.

### 3_json_files/ (ignored, generated)
This folder contains JSON files generated from the preprocessed data.

- **Generated by:**  
  `preprocessed_to_xlsx/main-inperson.js`
- **Input:**  
  `2_preprocessed_data/`
- **Output:**  
  JSON files used for downstream analyses and visualizations

This folder is **not included in the repository**, but can be recreated by running the conversion script.

> **Note:**  
> The `3_json_files/` folder must exist inside `data/` before running the conversion script. The script will populate the folder with output files.

### End_of_study_Q_sample.xlsx (tracked)

This file is a **sample version** of the end-of-study questionnaire data containing **synthetic (fake) responses** from four participants.

- The structure (column names and data format) matches the original Qualtrics export.
- No real participant data are included.
- The file is provided to allow users to run and inspect the questionnaire analysis pipeline.

The analysis script  
`end_of_study_questionnaire/Qualtrics inf_inperson.py`  
expects an Excel file with this structure as input.

### End_of_study_questionnaire_141.xlsx (ignored)
The full questionnaire dataset collected from 141 participants is **not publicly shared** due to privacy considerations.  
Derived variables used in the analyses are included in the preprocessed datasets.

> **Note:**
> To generate these files using the code provided (`end_of_study_questionnaire/Qualtrics inf_inperson.py`) change `End_of_study_questionnaire_141.xlsx` to `End_of_study_Q_sample.xlsx` in the code.

### json_vis230_Only (ignored, generated)
### json_vis250_Only (ignored, generated)
### json_vis270_Only (ignored, generated)
These folders contains JSON files generated from the preprocessed data.

- **Generated by:**  
  `explanatory_analysis/vis_speed_filter/visual_speed_filter.js`
- **Input:**  
  `2_preprocessed_data/`
- **Output:**  
  JSON files used for downstream analyses.

This folder is **not included in the repository**, but can be recreated by running the conversion script.
